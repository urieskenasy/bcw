                Baby Cyborg Warriors (or BCW) is a Play2Earn game hosted by the
                Ethereum network that combines two genres: story-based exploring
                and arena battles, for both single and team players. The BCW
                development team is concentrating on two key goals: a long-term
                Play2Earn economy and fun gameplay mechanisms.
